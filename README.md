# spotbot

A new way to create spotify playlists! Spotbot is a custom playlist generator for Spotify curated using tools such as OpenAI, Streamlit, and Spotipy.

Have you ever found yourself spending hours searching for the perfect playlist for your mood? Or is there a new genre of music you'd like to slowly explore? We extract your music tastes and history (specifically top 10 tracks and artists) to curate specially-tailored playlists designed by OpenAI's gpt models, based on your description of the playlist! Spotbot can even generate unique playlist titles and descriptions, and by using OpenAI's Dall-E model, can create an AI-generated cover image for you. All of this is then conveniently connected to your Spotify account so that you can save time searching, and start listening!
